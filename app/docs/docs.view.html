	<h2>What's inside the box?!</h2>
	<h3>Gulp</h3>
	<p>Automation. The Gulp file is set up for livereload on SASS, AngularJs, img and angular view chnages.</p>
	<p>The Sass stuff...don't worry its only a small file to start out with. Blow it up and put your own mark on it.</p>
	<p>You might notice that there are only minified files generated by Gulp. Don't fret, sourcemapping is set up for debuggin and readiblity. Less files, better experience in the browser dev tool.</p>
	<h3>AngularJS</h3>
	<p>Inside the MEAN seed is a miny AngularJS app seed to get you rollin</p>
	<h3>Express</h3>
	<p>MEAN seed is using the Express framework. Nuff said.</p>
	<h3>MongoDB</h3>
	<p>You dont need to use MongoDB, but there are some boiler plate files in here if you want to make your site dynamic, otherwise, ignorem or blow them up.</p>
